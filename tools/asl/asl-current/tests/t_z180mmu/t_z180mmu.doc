+----------------------- Test Application Z180MMU ---------------------------+
|                                                                            |
| This test plays with the CPU <-> physical mapping on the Z180.  It         |
| offers a physical memory of 512 KByte, which is mapped in three portions   |
| into the CPU's 64K address space.  Depending on the assumed values for     |
| CBAR, CBR, and BBR, AS will translate physical to CPU addresses.  Manual   |
| address translation is | possible via the cpu2phys() and phys2cpu()        |
| functions.                                                                 |
|                                                                            |

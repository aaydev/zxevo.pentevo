+------------------------- Test Application Z80REG --------------------------+
|                                                                            |
| This is a test of register symbols on the Z80/Z380.  The Z80's register    |
| set is not as orthogonal as e.g. on a 68K, so the main use is to define    |
| not as common register name aliases, like XH/XL for the halves of IX.      |
|                                                                            |

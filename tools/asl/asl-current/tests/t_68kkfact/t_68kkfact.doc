|  When storing packed decimals, the 68881/68882 has the option to set a     |
|  precision via a 'k factor'.  The 68KPRM was a bit ambiguous about where   |
|  to put the factor, so it is now allowed as suffix to either the attribute |
|  or the destination operand.                                               |

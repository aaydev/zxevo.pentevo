+-------------------------- Test Application GBZ80 --------------------------+
|                                                                            |
| This is a (synthetic) test of the Gameboy-Z80 instruction set.  It         |
| iterates once over the base, DD/FD and ED pages, of the Z80 instruction    |
| set and checks for instructions that are NOT implemented.  Note that some  |
| features left out on the GB Z80 (like the missing index registers) express |
| themselves as unallowed addressing modes and/or unknown symbols, since     |
| (IX+d) now gets interpreted as some sort of absolute addressing.           |

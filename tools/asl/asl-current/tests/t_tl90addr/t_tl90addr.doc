+----------------------- Test Application TL90ADDR ---------------------------+
|                                                                             |
|  The LDA, JP and CALL instructions on TLCS-90 only use the address of an    |
|  operand, namely load it into the program counter or another register.      |
|  Since direct register and immediate operation is not allowed, the ()       |
|  parentheses to signify indirect operation are not needed with these        |
|  instructions.                                                              |

+------------------------- Test Application Z80UNDOC ------------------------+
|                                                                            |
| This is a (synthetic) test of the Z80 instruction set, this time including |
| the undocumented instructions.  Note the name 'SLL' for the 8th shift/     |
| rotate instruction is not built- in, but has to be defined via a macro,    |
| since there are different opinions about what 'SLL' should mean.  Again,   |
| this was written based on the tables found at:                             |
